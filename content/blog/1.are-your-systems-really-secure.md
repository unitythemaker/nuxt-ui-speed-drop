## Are Your Systems Really Secure?

In an SAP system, the software migration architecture typically follows a DEV-QA-PROD structure. Custom developments (Z*, Y*, /CUSTOMER_NAMESPACE/\*) are transferred between these environments using the STMS (Transport Management System) tool. Released developments undergo approval processes through mechanisms like SOLMAN or JIRA.

However, how secure is the code being transferred? Are there dangerous or exploitable code blocks within the syntax that could pose security risks? SAP system administrators and security experts must be vigilant about such vulnerabilities.

Common issues include:

- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL code can be injected into queries, compromising the database.
- **Dynamic SQL:** Using unchecked dynamic SQL can lead to SQL injection attacks.
- **OS Command Execution:** Code that allows execution of operating system commands can be exploited to run unauthorized commands.
- **Incorrect File Operations:** Faulty read/write operations can lead to data leaks or corruption.
